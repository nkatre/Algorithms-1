- Create and check if a graph is bipartite
- Print all possible paths from a root to leaf in a BST
- Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number. An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123. Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
- Given a binary tree and a sum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
