Just glanced through it but not implemented:

- Evaluate a postfix expression
- Converting an expression from Infix to Postfix
- Kevin Bacon problem

TODO:

- infix to postfix expression
- Balancing BST (Red Black Trees: http://videolectures.net/mit6046jf05_demaine_lec10/)
- Interval Trees
- Read DFS from book

Knapsack
What does NP Complete mean?


OS: This is just a plug, from me, for you to know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. A lot of interviewers ask about that stuff, and it's pretty fundamental, so you should know it. Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work. Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs, and how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, and you'll be a dinosaur in a real hurry if you don't understand the fundamentals of "modern" (which is to say, "kinda broken") concurrency constructs.

Dijkstra's VS Bellman Ford (Single Source shortest path):
- Cannot handle cycles vs can handle cycles
- Better Time complexity (O(E + Vlog V)) vs. bad time complexity (O(VE))

Interesting problems (Not coded, but understood how things work):

- Check if a graph is a Bipartite graph or not: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bipartite-graph/
- Insert and search for Trie
- Check if a word is made up of two (or k, in general) valid words: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4902793/if-a-word-is-made-up-of-two-valid-words
- Running mean/median/mode
- Moving Average: http://invisibleblocks.com/2008/07/30/long-running-averages-without-the-sum-of-preceding-values/
