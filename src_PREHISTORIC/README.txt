[This has a lot of good code used for MSFT.]

Notes from BST chapter onwards:
===============================

[* denotes that I am not preparing these for the interview]

TODO:

- BST balancing*
- Delete an element from a BST (http://www.algolist.net/Data_structures/Binary_search_tree/Removal)
- Read slightly: Growth of functions (DAA : Page 44)
- Selection in expected linear time (Chapter 8)
- HashMaps from DAA book

REVISIT:

- Josephus Problem (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/josephus-problem-set-1-a-on-solution)
- Maximum subarray problem (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/)

To Prepare:

- How would you test an elevator?
- Design a logging system for distributed application.
- How do you test a website?
- Design an alarm clock for a deaf person.
- You're in a conference room and the window is broken. What's the temperature outside?
- How to design the testing of vending machine?
- You are an owner of a building, which has a broken revolving door. What time do you replace the door?
- Birthday paradox: http://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/
- How do you check if two linked lists meet or not.
- 
ALL:

Detect and Remove loop in linked list
Given a sum and n coins, divide the sum with the help of coins to get min num of coins
Find height of a tree
Given 2 strings delete all occurances of characters in the second string from the first string (http://techbhai.wordpress.com/2008/11/02/programming-practice-remove-specified-characters-from-input-string/)
Max contiguous subarry sum - return the start and end indices
Mirror of a tree with and without modifying the original tree (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4366251/mirror-image-of-a-binary-tree)
Large list of urls, delete duplicates
Write a program to add a node to a sorted list
Implement a single-linked list class.
Reverse the words in a sentence but keep the space.
Write a function to reverse a Linked List.
Write a function to determine if a number is prime.
Write a function to reverse an integer (i.e. 123 = 321), with O(1) space complexity.
Write a function to round a float to the nearest integer
Write a function to print all paths of a binary tree to a certain depth/length. [TODO - revise BFS/DFS]
Write a test to validate whether a tree is a BST or not and write every case tested.
A sorted array has been rotated. You need to find out the point of inflexion, i.e the position at which the smallest element of the array is present.(I did this in log n time) (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPt2BFU92dI)
You have a bit pattern and an infinite stream of bits coming in. You need to raise an alarm whenever the given pattern comes. Storing the stream is not allowed. [KMP Algorithm: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA2q3Y-MWZc]
It is a coding question: Given 2 strings write a program to find if they are anagrams are not. For example: abc and bca are 2 strings then it should return true because both strings have same length and also all the characters match each other. The count of the characters should also be same.
Write a class that adds or removes data from a queue.
Write a class that can store and interpret large integers (i.e., numbers that cannot be stored as an int). The class must be able to perform mathematical operations on the represented data.
Given a NxM board, how many ways are there to go from the left-top corner to the right-bottom corner? (http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/recreational-math/brain-teasers/v/path-counting-brain-teaser&usg=AFQjCNHUcpzohUpr_bRWOK3aN9BLqdSWRQ)
Write all permutations of a given string (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4240080/generating-all-permutations-of-a-given-string)



[TODO] KMP Algorithm (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-for-patterns-set-2-kmp-algorithm/)
[TODO] You have a c style string containing some spaces. Move the spaces to the starting of the string. Do it in place in one iteration.
[TODO] Given a binary tree, how would you set the keys/values of all the nodes and their child pointers to null [ITERATIVELY]


PASTE:
